# DOPEHIGH

DOPEHIGH.EXE is a simple tool to display the high scores list of the classic DOS game [Dopewars](https://archive.org/details/DopeWars1985HappyHackerFoundationStrategySimulation) by the Happy Hacker Foundation, an adaptation of the original [Drug Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drugwars) by John E. Dell.

Due to the scores being stored on disk in 4-byte Little-Endian format it is difficult to read them with a conventional text viewer. The only way to see the High Scores List inside the game is to finish a complete month (one game). This tool simply displays the High Scores from the command line.
